#### R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:
####  i) Decimals values like 4.5 are called numeric.
####  ii) Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numeric.
####  iii) Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
####  iv) Text (or string) values are called characters

# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "Universe"
my_logical <- FALSE
my_complex <- 10 + 11i

# Check class of my_numeric, my_character and my_logical
class(my_numeric)
class(my_character)
class(my_logical)
class(my_complex)

# Create a data frame from the vectors
planets_df <- data.frame(name,type,diameter,rotation,rings)
planets_df

# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded

# Print out diameter of Mercury (row 1, column 3)
planets_df[1,3]

# Print out data for Mars (entire fourth row)
planets_df[4,]

# Selection of data frame elements 
# 
# Instead of using numerics to select elements of a data frame, you can also use the variable names to select columns of a data frame.
# 
# Suppose you want to select the first three elements of the type column. One way to do this is

planets_df[1:3,2]

# A possible disadvantage of this approach is that you have to know (or look up) the column number of type, which gets hard if you have a lot of variables. It is often easier to just make use of the variable name:

planets_df[1:3,"type"]

str(planets_df)

#### Select first 5 values of diameter column
planets_df[1:5,"diameter"]

planets_df[,3]
planets_df[,"diameter"]

# There is a short-cut for above command. If your columns have names, you can use the $ sign to fetch all the values:
planets_df$diameter

# A list in R allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name (that is, the name of the list) in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists, etc. Lists can hold objects of different data types and different dimensions and hence enable us to bundle together a collection of heterogenous elements.

# When we use ???[ ]??? to subset a list, we get an object of the list type with the element at the specified position

# Another Example
# Vector with numerics from 1 up to 10

# What's a factor and why would you use it?

# The term factor refers to a statistical data type used to store categorical variables. The difference between a categorical variable and a continuous variable is that a categorical variable can belong to a limited number of categories. A continuous variable, on the other hand, can correspond to an infinite number of values.

# It is important that R knows whether it is dealing with a continuous or a categorical variable, as the statistical models you will develop in the future treat both types differently. (You will see later why this is the case.)

x <- factor(c("1", "2", "2", "1","1","2","1","2","2"))
x

# A good example of a categorical variable is sex. In many circumstances you can limit the sex categories to "Male" or "Female". (Sometimes you may need different categories. For example, you may need to consider chromosomal variation, hermaphroditic animals, or different cultural norms, but you will always have a finite number of categories.)

# Category vector
category_vector <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male")
typeof(category_vector)
# Convert Category_vector to a factor
factor_category_vector <- factor(category_vector)

# Print out factor_category_vector
factor_category_vector

# Another example

# Temperature
temperature_vector <- c("High", "Low", "High","Low", "Medium")
factor_temperature_vector <- factor(temperature_vector, order = TRUE, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
factor_temperature_vector

# Create speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("medium", "slow", "slow", "medium", "fast")

# Convert speed_vector to ordered factor vector
factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector,order=TRUE,levels = c("slow","medium","fast"))

# Print factor_speed_vector
